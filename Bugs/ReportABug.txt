If the script is not working, or is causing issues: please let me know what happens.
Some scripts have a built-in error logging system. Check if the script folder has an ErrorLog.txt file. If it exists, please send me the latest error.
If it does not: In the Scripts tab (on the bot), click on the Bug icon (Errors) (see image in this same folder), click refresh and try the script again. 
Wait until the problem occurs again, and send me what error you get.
